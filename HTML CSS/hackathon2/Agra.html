<h2>
 Introduction
</h2>

 <p class="first"> Agra is one of the most famous tourist destinations in India for a wonderful reason- Taj Mahal. Yet another reason to visit this city is for the majestic Agra Fort. Four generations of Mughals ruled India from Agra and lived in this beautiful and grand fort. But according to few studies, this fort was originally built by Lodis and was just renewed by the Mughals. The Mughals did everything to remove the evidence of Lodis from its history. Magnetic beauty of Agra Fort led it to become the first monument in India which was declared UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Agra Fort is just a few kilometres away from Taj Mahal. So, you can catch two beautiful architectural marvels in a single day</p>

<h3>
History
</h3>

<p>Did you know that this fort in Agra was originally a fortress made of bricks, owned by the Chauhan Rajputs? Historians note that after the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, Ibrahim Lodhi had moved to Agra and was living in the fort. He was conquered and killed by Babur, the first Mughal ruler, who then captured the fort and built a Baori or a stepwell in it.
    When the fort came under the control of Akbar, he decided to make it his capital. However, at that time, the fort was disintegrating and losing its glory and grandeur. So Akbar rebuilt the fort with red sandstone in its exteriors and bricks in its inner core. It took the diligent and laborious work of 1,444,000 builders for 8 long years to complete the construction of this fort in 1573.
    Though the construction of the Agra Fort is attributed to Akbar, it was built into what we see today under the reign of Shah Jahan, the grandson of Akbar. He demolished many buildings inside the fort and rebuilt palaces and mosques using white marbles. Later, after the battle of Samogarh in 1658, the fort came under the control Aurangzeb, the son of Shah Jahan, who locked his father here for 8 years until his death.
    After the death of Shah Jahan, the fort has been seized and plundered by many emperors and rulers. In 1803, during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, the Agra Fort was taken over by the British who handed its authority to the Government of India after independence.
